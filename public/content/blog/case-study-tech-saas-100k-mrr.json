B2B on TikTok works—here's exactly how they did it.\n\n## The Company Snapshot\n\n**TeamFlow**\n- Product: Project management software for small teams\n- Price: $29/user/month (avg team size: 12 users = $348/month)\n- Target audience: Team leads at startups and small businesses\n- Previous marketing: LinkedIn content, cold outreach\n- TikTok starting budget: $2,000/month\n- 6-month result: $100K MRR, 287 new customers, $2.87 CAC\n\n## Why TikTok for B2B?\n\nConventional wisdom says TikTok is B2C. TeamFlow proved otherwise.\n\n**Their Hypothesis:** Team leads are people too. They use TikTok. And B2B content on TikTok has zero competition.\n\n**The Reality:** Decision-makers in their target demographic (25-40) spend 45+ minutes/day on TikTok. Being where their attention is paid off.\n\n## Month 1-2: Finding What Works\n\n### Budget: $2,000/month ($500/week)\n\n**The Challenge:** B2B hooks on a consumer platform feel weird. How do you sell project management without sounding boring?\n\n**Testing Approach:** They tested 23 different hook variations across 4 content pillars.\n\n### Content Pillar 1: Pain Point Relatability\n\n**Hook Examples:**\n- \"I forgot to assign that task again\" - 2.1% CTR\n- \"My team keeps asking 'what should I work on?'\" - 2.8% CTR\n- \"Tired of status update meetings?\" - 3.1% CTR (winner)\n\n**Why it worked:** Universal team frustrations that resonate across industries.\n\n### Content Pillar 2: Time Savings\n\n**Hook Examples:**\n- \"This dashboard saved me 6 hours every week\" - 2.4% CTR\n- \"I automated my project updates. Here's how.\" - 2.7% CTR\n- \"Stop doing manual status reports\" - 2.9% CTR (winner)\n\n**Why it worked:** Time is the most valuable currency for team leads.\n\n### Content Pillar 3: Before/After Workflow\n\n**Hook Examples:**\n- \"Our workflow before vs. after TeamFlow\" - 1.9% CTR\n- \"How we onboarded 2x faster\" - 2.6% CTR (winner)\n- \"My team's output doubled with one change\" - 2.2% CTR\n\n**Why it worked:** Visual transformation is compelling, even for software.\n\n### Content Pillar 4: ROI/Metrics\n\n**Hook Examples:**\n- \"We cut project delivery time by 40%\" - 1.8% CTR\n- \"This tool paid for itself in 3 days\" - 2.3% CTR\n- \"Our team productivity increased 35%\" - 2.5% CTR (winner)\n\n**Why it worked:** Numbers build credibility. Specific metrics feel real.\n\n**Month 1-2 Results:**\n- Total ad spend: $4,000\n- Trials started: 127\n- Trial-to-paid conversion: 18% (23 customers)\n- MRR added: $8,004\n- CAC: $174\n- **Key insight:** Pain point hooks (Content Pillar 1) performed best.\n\n## Month 3-4: Scaling Winners\n\n### Budget: $5,000/month ($1,250/week)\n\n**Strategy:** Double down on pain point hooks, expand creative variations.\n\n### The Winner Hook: \"Tired of Status Update Meetings?\"\n\nThey created 5 variations of this hook:\n\n**Variation 1: Founder Story**\n- Content: Founder explaining how they built the solution\n- Style: Talking head, casual setting\n- Result: 2.8% CTR, $2.12 CAC (winner)\n\n**Variation 2: Screen Demo**\n- Content: Quick product walkthrough showing the feature\n- Style: Screen recording with voiceover\n- Result: 2.4% CTR, $2.47 CAC\n\n**Variation 3: Customer Testimonial**\n- Content: Real customer sharing their experience\n- Style: Zoom-style interview clip\n- Result: 3.1% CTR, $1.93 CAC (winner)\n\n**Variation 4: Problem/Solution**\n- Content: Show the pain, then the solution\n- Style: Text-on-screen + product demo\n- Result: 2.6% CTR, $2.23 CAC\n\n**Variation 5: Myth-Busting**\n- Content: \"You don't need more meetings, you need better tools\"\n- Style: Contrarian take + product demo\n- Result: 2.9% CTR, $2.01 CAC\n\n**Key Learning:** Customer testimonials (Variation 3) had highest CTR and lowest CAC.\n\n**Month 3-4 Results:**\n- Total ad spend: $10,000\n- Trials started: 342\n- Trial-to-paid conversion: 22% (75 customers)\n- MRR added: $26,100\n- CAC: $133 (down 24% from Month 1-2)\n\n## Month 5-6: Optimization & Expansion\n\n### Budget: $10,000/month ($2,500/week)\n\n**Three Parallel Strategies:**\n\n### Strategy A: Scale Top Creatives\n- Top 5 performing ads\n- Budget: $6,000/month\n- Result: 87 trials, 21 conversions, $7,308 MRR\n- CAC: $286\n\n### Strategy B: Test New Verticals\n- Agencies, consultancies, marketing teams\n- Budget: $2,000/month\n- Result: 34 trials, 5 conversions, $1,740 MRR\n- CAC: $400 (higher, but new vertical)\n\n### Strategy C: Retargeting\n- Website visitors, trial starters who didn't convert\n- Budget: $2,000/month\n- Result: 67 trials, 24 conversions, $8,352 MRR\n- CAC: $83 (winner)\n\n**Month 5-6 Results:**\n- Total ad spend: $20,000\n- Total trials: 782\n- Total conversions: 189\n- MRR added: $65,892\n- CAC: $106 (down 20% from Month 3-4)\n\n## The Complete Funnel Breakdown\n\n### Top of Funnel: TikTok Ads\n- **Impressions:** 2.3M\n- **Clicks:** 52,000\n- **CTR:** 2.26%\n- **CPC:** $0.58\n- **Landing page visits:** 48,000 (92% of clicks)\n\n### Middle of Funnel: Trial Sign-ups\n- **Landing page visitors:** 48,000\n- **Trial sign-ups:** 1,251\n- **Conversion rate:** 2.6%\n- **Cost per trial start:** $21.58\n\n### Bottom of Funnel: Paid Conversions\n- **Trial starters:** 1,251\n- **Trial-to-paid:** 287\n- **Conversion rate:** 22.9%\n- **CAC:** $93.91\n- **ARPU:** $348/month\n- **LTV (12-month):** $4,176\n- **LTV:CAC ratio:** 44.5x\n\n## The Highest-Performing Creative\n\n### \"Tired of Status Update Meetings?\" - Customer Testimonial Version\n\n**Hook:** \"Tired of status update meetings? Here's what we did instead.\"\n\n**Content:**\n> **[0-5s]** Quick shot of empty meeting room. Text: \"We stopped doing these.\"\n>\n> **[5-15s]** Customer (real, not actor): \"We were wasting 6 hours a week in status meetings. Found TeamFlow, cut meetings to 30 minutes.\"\n>\n> **[15-30s]** Quick product demo: See how updates happen in the tool instead.\n>\n> **[30-40s]** Specific result: \"My team actually likes it.

They optimized:\n\n### Before (General Landing Page)\n- Hero: \"The best project management tool\"\n- Social proof: \"Used by 1,000+ teams\"\n- CTA: \"Start free trial\"\n- Conversion rate: 1.8%\n\n### After (TikTok-Optimized)\n- Hero: \"Cut status meetings by 80%\" (matches hook)\n- Social proof: \"Watch how Sarah's team saved 6 hours/week\" (video embed)\n- Specific benefit: \"14-day free trial, no credit card required\"\n- CTA: \"Try it free →\"\n- Conversion rate: 3.1% (+72% improvement)\n\n**Key Change:** Message match between ad and landing page.\n\n## The Email Follow-Up Sequence\n\nTrial engagement is critical. They built a 5-email sequence:\n\n### Email 1 (Day 0): Welcome + Quick Win\n- Subject: \"Get started in 5 minutes\"\n- Content: Short tutorial video, first project template\n- Open rate: 67%\n- Click rate: 34%\n\n### Email 2 (Day 2): Check-in + Help\n- Subject: \"How's it going?\"\n- Content: Offer help, common questions answered\n- Open rate: 54%\n- Reply rate: 12%\n\n### Email 3 (Day 5): Feature Deep-Dive\n- Subject: \"The feature that saves the most time\"\n- Content: Advanced feature walkthrough\n- Open rate: 48%\n- Feature adoption: +23%\n\n### Email 4 (Day 10): Social Proof\n- Subject: \"How [similar company] uses TeamFlow\"\n- Content: Case study, ROI calculator\n- Open rate: 52%\n- Conversion impact: +8%\n\n### Email 5 (Day 13): Final Push\n- Subject: \"Trial ends tomorrow\"\n- Content: Discount offer (20% off first year)\n- Open rate: 61%\n- Conversion lift: +15%\n\n## What Didn't Work\n\n### Failed Test 1: Explainer Videos\n- **Content:** 2-minute animated explainer about features\n- **Result:** 1.1% CTR, high CPC ($1.24)\n- **Learning:** TikTok users don't want long explanations. Quick value proposition wins.\n\n### Failed Test 2: LinkedIn-Style Professional Content\n- **Content:** Formal introductions, corporate language\n- **Result:** 0.9% CTR\n- **Learning:** TikTok rewards authenticity, not polish. Casual > corporate.\n\n### Failed Test 3: Broad B2B Targeting\n- **Test:** \"Business owners 25-55\" (too broad)\n- **Result:** Low trial-to-paid (14%)\n- **Learning:** Narrow targeting (team leads, startup founders) performed better.\n\n### Failed Test 4: Discount-Heavy Messaging\n- **Test:** \"50% off your first year\"\n- **Result:** High trial starts, low conversion (trial-to-paid: 8%)\n- **Learning:** Discounts attract bad-fit customers. Value messaging attracts better fits.\n\n## The Replicable B2B TikTok Framework\n\n### Step 1: Identify Your Core Pain Point\nWhat frustrates your target customer?\n- Status update meetings → automated updates\n- Lost leads → better CRM\n- Missed deadlines → project management\n\n### Step 2: Create a \"Time Savings\" Hook\nQuantify the benefit:\n- \"Save 6 hours/week\"\n- \"Cut meeting time by 80%\"\n- \"Onboard 2x faster\"\n\n### Step 3: Show the Product (Briefly)\nQuick demo (15-20 seconds max):\n- Screen recording is fine\n- Show the key feature\n- Don't explain everything\n\n### Step 4: Add Social Proof\nCustomer testimonials work best:\n- Real customer, not actor\n- Specific result they achieved\n- Authentic delivery\n\n### Step 5: Simple CTA\nNo friction:\n- \"Try it free for 14 days\"\n- \"No credit card required\"\n- \"Link in bio\"\n\n## Your 90-Day B2B TikTok Launch Plan\n\n### Days 1-30: Discovery\n- Create 15-20 hook variations\n- Test at $50-100/day per creative\n- Identify top 3 performers\n- Goal: Find what works\n\n### Days 31-60: Validation\n- Scale top 3 hooks to $200-400/day each\n- Add retargeting layer\n- Optimize landing page for message match\n- Goal: Validate CAC < LTV\n\n### Days 61-90: Optimization\n- Expand to adjacent verticals\n- Test offer variations (trial length, discounts)\n- Build email nurture sequence\n- Goal: Lower CAC, increase conversion\n\n## Final Metrics Summary\n\n### 6-Month Totals\n- **Total Ad Spend:** $34,000\n- **Total Trials:** 1,251\n- **Total Conversions:** 287\n- **Final MRR:** $100,000 (started at $20K)\n- **MRR Added:** $80,000\n- **Average CAC:** $118\n- **Average ARPU:** $348/month\n- **12-Month LTV:** $4,176\n- **LTV:CAC Ratio:** 35.4x\n- **Payback Period:** 3.4 months\n- **Trial-to-Paid Conversion:** 22.9%\n\n### By Month\n| Month | Ad Spend | Trials | Conversions | MRR Added | CAC |\n|-------|----------|--------|-------------|-----------|-----|\n| 1 | $2,000 | 62 | 11 | $3,828 | $182 |\n| 2 | $2,000 | 65 | 12 | $4,176 | $167 |\n| 3 | $5,000 | 156 | 38 | $13,224 | $132 |\n| 4 | $5,000 | 186 | 37 | $12,876 | $135 |\n| 5 | $10,000 | 387 | 93 | $32,364 | $108 |\n| 6 | $10,000 | 395 | 96 | $33,408 | $104 |\n| **Total** | **$34,000** | **1,251** | **287** | **$99,876** | **$118** |\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n### 1.
