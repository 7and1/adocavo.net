Understanding the TikTok Algorithm\n\n### How the TikTok Algorithm Works\n\nUnlike other platforms, TikTok's algorithm prioritizes **content quality** over **creator authority** or **follower count**.\n\n### Key Algorithm Factors\n\n**1. Watch Time (Most Important)**\n- Completion rate: % of video watched\n- Rewatches: Does the viewer watch it again?\n- Session time: Does it keep them on the app?\n\n**2. Engagement**\n- Likes, comments, shares\n- Saves (indicates high value)\n- Clicks to profile/website\n\n**3. Video Information**\n- Caption keywords\n- Hashtags\n- Sounds/music\n- Visual content analysis\n\n**4. User Device/Account**\n- Location (for local targeting)\n- Language preferences\n- Device type\n- Past interaction with similar content\n\n### The \"Viral\" Threshold\n\nVideos go viral when they hit these benchmarks:\n- **70%+ completion rate**\n- **10%+ like rate** (likes:views)\n- **5%+ share rate**\n- **2%+ save rate**\n\n### Algorithm Optimization Tips\n\n1. **Front-load value** - Hook in first 1-2 seconds\n2. **Keep it short** - Under 30 seconds ideal\n3. **End with engagement prompt** - Comment question, CTA\n4. **Use trending audio** - But make it relevant\n5. **Post at optimal times** - 7am, 12pm, 6pm local time\n\n---\n\n<a name=\"tiktok-ad-formats-explained\"></a>\n## 3.

Common TikTok Ad Mistakes to Avoid\n\n### Mistake 1: Weak Hooks\n\n**Problem:** Starting with brand context or generic introduction\n- ❌ \"Hi, I'm [name] from [company] and today I'll show you...\"\n- ✅ \"Stop scrolling if you have [problem]\"\n\n**Fix:** Hook in first 1-2 seconds. Address the viewer, not yourself.\n\n### Mistake 2: Over-Production\n\n**Problem:** Polished, commercial-style content\n- **Result:** Low engagement, feels like \"ad\"\n- **Why:** TikTok users want authenticity\n\n**Fix:** Use UGC-style content. Real people, real settings, real delivery.\n\n### Mistake 3: Ignoring Mobile\n\n**Problem:** Designing for desktop\n- **Result:** Poor mobile experience = lost sales\n- **Reality:** 85%+ of TikTok traffic is mobile\n\n**Fix:** Mobile-first design. Large buttons, minimal text, fast loading.\n\n### Mistake 4: Generic CTAs\n\n**Problem:** Vague calls-to-action\n- ❌ \"Check it out\" / \"Learn more\"\n- ✅ \"Shop Now - 20% off today only\"\n\n**Fix:** Specific, urgent, benefit-driven CTAs.\n\n### Mistake 5: Testing Too Much at Once\n\n**Problem:** Changing creative, targeting, and offer simultaneously\n- **Result:** Can't isolate what worked\n\n**Fix:** Test one variable at a time. Creative first, then targeting, then offer.\n\n### Mistake 6: Scaling Too Fast\n\n**Problem:** Increasing budget 200-300% at once\n- **Result:** Performance drops, wasted spend\n\n**Fix:** Scale gradually (20-30% increases every 3-4 days).\n\n### Mistake 7: Neglecting Retention\n\n**Problem:** Focusing only on acquisition\n- **Result:** High churn, low LTV\n\n**Fix:** Build email/SMS lists. Nurture customers. Focus on LTV, not just CAC.\n\n### Mistake 8: Wrong Platform Expectations\n\n**Problem:** Expecting TikTok to behave like Facebook\n- **Result:** Frustration, poor results\n\n**Fix:** Understand TikTok's unique algorithm, audience, and content style.\n\n---\n\n<a name=\"tiktok-ads-vs-other-platforms\"></a>\n## 19.

FAQ\n\n### Q: How much should I spend on TikTok ads?\n**A:** Start with $500-1,000 for testing. Scale once you find winners. Most brands spend $2,000-10,000/month once validated.\n\n### Q: What's a good ROAS for TikTok ads?\n**A:** 3x is breakeven for most businesses. 4x+ is healthy. 5x+ is excellent.\n\n### Q: How long does it take to see results?\n**A:** 7-14 days for initial data. 30-60 days for validated results.\n\n### Q: Do I need a TikTok presence to run ads?\n**A:** No, but having an organic presence helps. Organic content can be amplified with Spark Ads.\n\n### Q: What's the ideal video length?\n**A:** 15-30 seconds. Under 15 seconds is okay for product demos. Avoid 60+ seconds.\n\n### Q: Should I use music in my ads?\n**A:** Yes, but make it relevant. Trending audio can help, but don't force it.\n\n### Q: Can I target by income or education?\n**A:** No. TikTok doesn't offer income/education targeting. Use interests and behaviors instead.\n\n### Q: How often should I refresh creatives?\n**A:** Every 2-4 weeks. Monitor performance—refresh when you see creative fatigue (declining CTR).\n\n### Q: Should I use TikTok's automated creative tools?\n**A:** They're getting better, but human creative still outperforms. Use automation for scaling, not initial creation.\n\n### Q: Can I retarget website visitors?\n**A:** Yes. Install the TikTok Pixel and create custom audiences based on website behavior.\n\n### Q: What's the minimum budget for testing?\n**A:** $50-100/day per creative for 3-5 days = $150-500 minimum per test.\n\n### Q: Should I hire an agency or manage in-house?\n**A:**\n- **In-house:** Lower cost, more control, better product knowledge\n- **Agency:** Expertise, faster results, higher cost (15-25% of ad spend)\n\n**Recommendation:** Start in-house, hire agency when scaling past $10K/month.\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps\n\nYou now have everything you need to succeed with TikTok advertising in 2026.\n\n**Ready to start?**\n\n1.
