    excerpt:
      "A step-by-step framework for writing TikTok ad scripts that feel native, hook fast, and drive conversions. Learn the 5-part structure used by top performers.",
    content: `# How to Write TikTok Ad Scripts That Convert: The Complete Framework

TikTok ads win when they feel like real creator content. Use this framework to build scripts that hook instantly and sell without sounding like an ad.

## Why TikTok Scripts Are Different

TikTok users have an eight-second attention span. Your ad needs to feel like content from someone they follow, not a commercial interrupting their experience. The most successful TikTok ads follow a specific structure that respects the platform's native format.

## The 5-Part TikTok Script Framework

### 1) Open with a Scroll-Stopping Hook

The first three seconds determine whether someone stays or swipes. Your hook must do one of three things: call out a specific audience, create curiosity, or challenge a belief.

**Direct Callout Examples:**
- "Stop scrolling if you have acne."
- "If you sell on Shopify, watch this."
- "This is for anyone struggling with weight loss."

**Curiosity Gap Examples:**
- "I wish I knew this before wasting $300."
- "The secret to glowing skin isn't what you think."
- "Wait for the before and after."

**Contrarian Examples:**
- "Stop doing cardio if you want to lose fat."
- "Why your skincare routine isn't working."
- "This is why most online businesses fail."

### 2) Show the Problem (1-2 Sentences)

Keep it tight. Show the pain, failed attempts, and frustration. This builds relatability and trust.

**Example:** "I tried every serum out there. Nothing worked. My skin actually got worse."

### 3) Reveal the Product as the Solution

Introduce the product naturally with specifics: price point, time to results, or a personal discovery story. Avoid generic praise.

**Example:** "Then I found this $12 cleanser. Within two weeks, my texture was completely gone."

### 4) Add Social Proof

Social proof is a shortcut to trust. Use review counts, creator reactions, or viral validation.

**Examples:**
- "This has 15,000 five-star reviews."
- "Everyone kept asking what I was using."
- "This video blew up for a reason."

### 5) Close with a Clear CTA

Make the action specific and urgent. Avoid generic "check it out" language.

**Examples:**
- "Link in bio—try it risk-free for 30 days."
- "Only 50 left at this price—link below."
- "Use code TIKTOK20 for 20% off your first order."

## Complete Script Example

Here's a full script using the framework for a fictional skincare brand:

> **Hook:** "Stop scrolling if your acne cleanser isn't working."
>
> **Problem:** "I spent hundreds on expensive products. My skin only got worse. I was about to give up."
>
> **Product:** "Then I discovered this brand with just three ingredients. No harsh chemicals, no BS. And it's only $18."
>
> **Proof:** "Two weeks later, my breakouts were gone. Even my mom asked what I was using."
>
> **CTA:** "Link in bio. Try it for 30 days—if it doesn't work, you get a full refund."

## Pro Tips for Better Scripts

1. **Write like you talk** - Use contractions, fragments, and casual language. Avoid "corporate" words like "utilize," "leverage," or "optimize."
2. **Keep sentences under 15 words** - TikTok moves fast. Long sentences lose people.
3. **Use specific numbers** - "$12" beats "affordable." "Two weeks" beats "quickly."
4. **Test multiple angles** - Create 3-5 variations of each script using different hooks.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Starting with brand context** - Nobody cares about your company history. Start with the viewer's problem.
- **Generic benefits** - "Transform your skin" is weak. "See results in 14 days" is strong.
- **Too much information** - One problem, one solution, one clear CTA. That's it.
- **Sounding like an ad** - If it feels promotional, it will perform poorly. Make it feel like a recommendation from a friend.

## Ready-to-Use Template

Copy this structure and fill in the blanks:

**Hook:** [Call out specific audience or create curiosity]

**Problem:** [Describe the frustration and failed attempts in 1-2 sentences]

**Product:** [Introduce your product with a specific price or timeframe]

**Proof:** [Add social proof or personal results]

**CTA:** [Specific action with urgency or incentive]

      "Discover the hook patterns top TikTok ads use to stop the scroll. Learn the psychology behind viral hooks and how to remix them for any product.",
    content: `# Viral Hook Patterns: The 3-Second Rule That Stops the Scroll

The fastest way to improve ad performance is to fix the first three seconds. Here are the proven patterns that drive engagement across every category.

## The Science of the Three-Second Hook

TikTok's algorithm prioritizes watch time. If someone doesn't watch past three seconds, your ad gets buried. The most successful hooks trigger one of three psychological responses: identification ("this is for me"), curiosity ("I need to know more"), or controversy ("I disagree with this").

## Pattern 1: The Direct Callout

**Psychology:** Identification. You're filtering for the exact people who need your product.

**Formula:** "Stop scrolling if [specific condition]"

**Examples by Category:**

- **Beauty:** "Stop scrolling if you have textured skin."
- **Fitness:** "This is for anyone who hates leg day."
- **Tech:** "If you work from home, listen to this."
- **Finance:** "Side hustlers, this is your sign."
- **Food:** "If you hate cooking, this is for you."

**Why it works:** You're not interrupting their scroll—you're giving them permission to stop because you're speaking directly to their situation.

## Pattern 2: The Curiosity Gap

**Psychology:** Information gap theory. People feel tension when there's a gap between what they know and what they want to know.

**Formula:** "I didn't believe [claim] until [reveal]"

**Examples by Category:**

- **Beauty:** "I didn't believe a $7 serum could work until..."
- **Fitness:** "I thought this exercise was useless until I tried this variation."
- **Tech:** "I thought this gadget was a scam until it saved me two hours a day."
- **Finance:** "I thought investing was only for rich people until I learned this."

**Why it works:** Skepticism is the default state on TikTok. Admitting initial doubt builds authenticity.

## Pattern 3: The Contrarian Take

**Psychology:** Pattern interruption. Contradicting conventional wisdom makes people stop to understand why.

**Formula:** "Stop [common action] if you want [desired outcome]"

**Examples by Category:**

- **Beauty:** "Stop using moisturizer if you have oily skin."
- **Fitness:** "Stop doing cardio if you want to lose fat."
- **Tech:** "Stop buying expensive cables."
- **Finance:** "Stop saving money if you want to build wealth."

**Why it works:** Controversy drives engagement—even people who disagree will watch to see your reasoning.

## Pattern 4: The Social Proof Swipe

**Psychology:** Social validation. If others are paying attention, we should too.

**Formula:** "Everyone asked/reacted/commented [about what]"

**Examples by Category:**

- **Beauty:** "Everyone kept asking what I was using."
- **Fitness:** "My trainer couldn't believe my progress."
- **Tech:** "This is the gadget that's all over my comments."
- **Finance:** "This is the side hustle everyone's talking about."

**Why it works:** FOMO (fear of missing out) is powerful. If "everyone" is doing something, we want to know what we're missing.

## Pattern 5: The Before/After Tease

**Psychology:** Visual proof. The promise of transformation drives engagement.

**Formula:** "Wait for the [timeframe] results"

**Examples by Category:**

- **Beauty:** "Wait for the 30-day transformation."
- **Fitness:** "You have to see my 8-week progress."
- **Tech:** "Watch what happens when I use this."
- **Home:** "Before and after coming in 3... 2... 1..."

**Why it works:** TikTok is a visual platform. Promising a visible outcome keeps people watching.

## Pattern 6: The "Don't Buy" Hook

**Psychology:** Reverse psychology. Telling people NOT to do something makes them want to do it more.

**Formula:** "Don't buy [product] until you know [information]"

**Examples by Category:**

- **Beauty:** "Don't buy retinol until you watch this."
- **Fitness:** "Don't buy a gym membership until you hear this."
- **Tech:** "Don't upgrade your phone yet."
- **Finance:** "Don't invest in crypto until you understand this."

**Why it works:** It positions you as a helpful advisor rather than a seller, building trust.

## How to Remix Any Hook Pattern

Follow this 3-step process to adapt these patterns to your product:

1. **Select the pattern** that best fits your product category (social proof for beauty, contrarian for fitness, etc.)

2. **Insert your specific detail** - The more specific, the better. "Skincare" becomes "retinol for sensitive skin." "Fitness" becomes "leg day for beginners."

3. **Test variations** - Create 3-5 versions of each hook with different angles and see what resonates.

## Hook Testing Checklist

Before running your ad, ask yourself:

- [ ] Does it address a specific audience or pain point?
- [ ] Is it under 10 words?
- [ ] Does it create curiosity, controversy, or identification?
- [ ] Would it make you stop scrolling?
- [ ] Does it sound like something a real person would say?

## Example: Hook Remix for a Coffee Brand

**Original Pattern:** "Stop scrolling if you have back pain."

**Category-Specific Remix:** "Stop scrolling if you're tired of overpriced coffee."

**Curiosity Version:** "I didn't believe a $20 coffee maker could work until..."

**Contrarian Version:** "Stop buying expensive coffee beans."

**Social Proof Version:** "Everyone asks why my morning coffee tastes so good."

      "Discover the highest-converting hooks for beauty, skincare, and makeup brands on TikTok. These patterns have generated millions in sales for DTC brands.",
    content: `# 10 Beauty TikTok Ad Hooks That Actually Convert

Beauty brands are crushing it on TikTok because the platform is perfectly suited for visual product demonstrations. Here are the hook patterns that consistently drive conversions, with examples you can adapt for your brand.

## Why Beauty Performs So Well on TikTok

TikTok's format aligns perfectly with beauty content: close-up shots, before/after transformations, and authentic reviews from real users. The beauty brands winning on TikTok don't run ads—they create content that happens to sell products.

## 1. The "Stop Scrolling If" Hook

> "Stop scrolling if you have textured skin."

**Why it works:** You're filtering for your exact audience. People with textured skin will feel seen and stop to hear the solution.

**Variations:**
- "Stop scrolling if you have acne."
- "This is for anyone with oily eyelids."
- "If your foundation always separates, watch this."

## 2. The Product Reveal Hook

> "I found a $12 dupe for a $80 serum."

**Why it works:** Value proposition is immediate. You're promising savings without sacrifice.

**Variations:**
- "This $7 cream works better than my $90 moisturizer."
- "The drugstore find that replaced my entire skincare routine."
- "Why I stopped buying expensive serums."

## 3. The Timeline Hook

> "Wait for my 30-day skin transformation."

**Why it works:** TikTok loves before/afters. You're promising a payoff at the end.

**Variations:**
- "My skin after two weeks of using this."
- "The 7-day challenge that changed my skin."
- "What happened when I used this for a month."

## 4. The Ingredient Education Hook

> "Stop using retinol if you have sensitive skin."

**Why it works:** You're positioning yourself as an expert, not a seller. Education builds trust.

**Variations:**
- "The ingredient that's actually causing your breakouts."
- "Why your vitamin C serum isn't working."
- "The skincare ingredient dermatologists hate."

## 5. The Routine Simplification Hook

> "I went from 10 steps to 3 and my skin got better."

**Why it works:** Overwhelm is common in skincare. You're offering simplicity.

**Variations:**
- "The minimal skincare routine that actually works."
- "Why I stopped using toner."
- "The only three products you actually need."

## 6. The Packaging ASMR Hook

> "This packaging is so satisfying."

**Why it works:** ASMR is huge on TikTok. Satisfying sounds keep people watching.

**Variations:**
- "You need to hear this bottle open."
- "The most satisfying moisturizer texture."
- "Watch this foundation melt into the skin."

## 7. The "Everyone Asked" Hook

> "Everyone kept asking why my skin was glowing."

**Why it works:** Social proof combined with curiosity creates powerful engagement.

**Variations:**
- "The product my friends won't stop asking about."
- "What I was using when my skin looked the best."
- "The TikTok find that broke my comments section."

## 8. The Problem-Solution Hook

> "I tried everything for my acne. Nothing worked. Then this."

**Why it works:** You're validating their frustration before offering hope.

**Variations:**
- "Two years of acne, cured in two weeks."
- "The product that finally fixed my dry patches."
- "After 20 failed products, I found this."

## 9. The Comparison Hook

> "Expensive vs. affordable skincare—is there a difference?"

**Why it works:** People want validation for their spending choices. Controversy drives comments.

**Variations:**
- "Testing a viral \$200 serum against a \$15 dupe."
- "Is the expensive stuff actually better?"
- "Splurge vs. save: skincare edition."

## 10. The "Don't Buy" Hook

> "Don't buy retinol until you watch this."

**Why it works:** Reverse psychology builds trust. You seem helpful, not salesy.

**Variations:**
- "Don't buy new skincare until you finish this video."
- "Please stop using this ingredient."
- "Read this before buying expensive skincare."

## Beauty Brand Script Template

Here's a complete script framework you can use:

> **Hook:** "Stop scrolling if you struggle with [specific problem]."
>
> **Problem:** "I tried everything. [Product A], [Product B], nothing worked. It was so frustrating."
>
> **Solution:** "Then I found [your product] for [price]."
>
> **Proof:** "Within [timeframe], my skin [specific result]. Even my [friend/family/mom] noticed."
>
> **CTA:** "Link in bio. Try it for [guarantee period], risk-free."

## Pro Tips for Beauty Ads

1. **Show, don't just tell** - Close-up shots of texture and application work better than talking about it.
2. **Use natural lighting** - Overhead lights look artificial. Natural light builds authenticity.
3. **Include the price** - Beauty shoppers compare. Being upfront about price builds trust.
4. **Target specific concerns** - "Good for all skin types" is weak. "Perfect for hormonal acne" is strong.
5. **Be honest about limitations** - "This won't work for cystic acne, but for occasional breakouts, it's been game-changing."

## Common Beauty Ad Mistakes

- **Over-promising** - "Cures acne overnight" will get flagged and damage trust.
- **Generic praise** - "This changed my life" is less credible than specific results.
- **Ignoring skin tone diversity** - Show the product working on different skin tones.
- **Too much makeup** - Skincare should look natural. Heavy makeup undermines credibility.
- **Skipping ingredients** - TikTok users are educated. Mention what makes your product work.

## Complete Example: Lightweight Moisturizer Ad

> **Hook:** "Stop scrolling if you hate greasy moisturizer."
>
> **Problem:** "Every product I tried made me look oily by noon. I literally stopped using moisturizer altogether."
>
> **Solution:** "Then I found this gel-cream formula. \$16, oil-free, and it actually absorbs."
>
> **Proof:** "Two weeks in, my skin is hydrated but not shiny. Even in summer. The bottle has 8,000 five-star reviews."
>
> **CTA:** "Link in bio. Free shipping on orders over \$25."

      "Learn the hook patterns that work for tech products, apps, and gadgets on TikTok. Includes examples from successful tech marketing campaigns.",
    content: `# Tech Product TikTok Ads: Hooks That Convert Gadgets and Apps

Tech products face a unique challenge on TikTok: overcoming skepticism while explaining value quickly. Here are the hook patterns that consistently convert for tech brands, with real examples you can adapt.

## The Tech Marketing Challenge on TikTok

TikTok users are young and skeptical of blatant promotion. Tech ads that work don't look like ads—they look like someone genuinely excited about a find or frustrated with a problem you can solve.

## 1. The Problem-Solution Hook

> "I finally found the solution to [painful tech problem]."

**Why it works:** Tech users have specific frustrations. You're validating their pain before offering a solution.

**Examples:**
- "I finally found a charging cable that doesn't break."
- "The fix for my WFH back pain that actually works."
- "My laptop battery died every 3 hours until this."

## 2. The Value Comparison Hook

> "This \$50 gadget does what the \$200 one does."

**Why it works:** Tech shoppers compare specs and prices. You're positioning your product as the smart choice.

**Examples:**
- "Why I stopped buying expensive headphones."
- "The \$20 keyboard that replaced my \$150 one."
- "Don't buy a new laptop until you see this."

## 3. The Productivity Hook

> "This app saves me 2 hours every day."

**Why it works:** Productivity is a universal desire. Specific time claims are credible and compelling.

**Examples:**
- "The app that handles my email for me."
- "How I finish work by 3 PM every day."
- "The tool that cut my meeting time in half."

## 4. The "I Didn't Know I Needed This" Hook

> "I didn't know I needed this until I tried it."

**Why it works:** It positions your product as a discovery rather than a purchase. People love finding useful things.

**Examples:**
- "I didn't know I needed a mini label maker until..."
- "This dumb little gadget changed my WFH setup."
- "The purchase I didn't know I needed."

## 5. The Before/After Setup Hook

> "My desk before vs. after this one purchase."

**Why it works:** Transformation content performs exceptionally well. Tech setups are visually satisfying.

**Examples:**
- "My WFH setup transformation for under \$100."
- "The cable management hack that changed everything."
- "Before and after: my gaming corner."

## 6. The Feature Demo Hook

> "Watch what happens when I use this."

**Why it works:** Tech products often have wow factors. Showing is better than explaining.

**Examples:**
- "You have to see this keyboard in action."
- "Watch this gadget clean my keyboard."
- "The moment I tried these headphones, I was sold."

## 7. The "Why Didn't I Know" Hook

> "Why did nobody tell me about this?"

**Why it works:** It implies widespread knowledge or use, creating FOMO and social proof.

**Examples:**
- "Why am I just now finding out about this app?"
- "How does everyone know about this except me?"
- "The tech tip I wish I knew years ago."

## 8. The Specific Scenario Hook

> "If you [situation], you need this."

**Why it works:** Niche targeting creates higher conversion. You're speaking directly to people in specific situations.

**Examples:**
- "If you work from a coffee shop, you need this."
- "If you edit video on a laptop, listen to this."
- "If your WiFi always cuts out, watch this."

## 9. The Packaging/Unboxing Hook

> "The packaging alone is worth it."

**Why it works:** Unboxing is a proven content category. Premium packaging implies premium product.

**Examples:**
- "This might be the best packaging I've ever seen."
- "The unboxing experience is actually insane."
- "This brand understands packaging."

## 10. The Honest Review Hook

> "I tested this for 30 days. Here's the truth."

**Why it works:** Reviewers are trusted more than brands. Honest-sounding content builds credibility.

**Examples:**
- "Is this viral gadget actually worth it?"
- "I tested the hype. Here's what happened."
- "Brutally honest review: [product name]."

## Tech Product Script Template

> **Hook:** "If you [specific situation], stop scrolling."
>
> **Problem:** "I was struggling with [pain point] for [timeframe]. Tried [alternatives], nothing worked."
>
> **Solution:** "Then I found [your product] for [price point]."
>
> **Demo:** "Watch what it does..." [show the feature]
>
> **Proof:** "[Time period] later, [specific result]."
>
> **CTA:** "Link in bio. [Guarantee or incentive]."

## Pro Tips for Tech Ads

1. **Show the product in action** - Tech is visual. Demonstrations work better than descriptions.
2. **Include the price** - Tech shoppers compare. Be transparent to build trust.
3. **Highlight one key feature** - Don't overwhelm. Pick your strongest differentiator.
4. **Use authentic settings** - Real homes, real desks, real messy cords.
5. **Address skepticism** - "I was skeptical too" validates their doubts.

## Common Tech Ad Mistakes

- **Too technical** - Your audience isn't engineers. Speak in benefits, not specs.
- **Generic "revolutionary" claims** - Every product claims to be revolutionary. Be specific.
- **Ignoring price sensitivity** - Tech shoppers compare. Address why yours is worth it.
- **Over-produced content** - Polished commercials feel out of place on TikTok. Keep it raw.
- **Missing the use case** - Don't just show features. Show how it solves real problems.

## Complete Example: Wireless Charger Ad

> **Hook:** "If you're still plugging in your phone, watch this."
>
> **Problem:** "I was constantly fighting for outlets. My charger was always tangled or falling behind my desk."
>
> **Solution:** "Found this magnetic wireless pad for \$25. Stick it to your desk, drop your phone, it charges."
>
> **Demo:** "Watch—just drop and go. Works through cases too."
>
> **Proof:** "Three months in, I've used my cable maybe twice. My desk is finally clean."
>
> **CTA:** "Link in bio. Free returns within 30 days if you hate it."

## SaaS and App Script Template

> **Hook:** "This app saves me [X] hours every week."
>
> **Problem:** "I was spending [timeframe] on [tedious task]. It was burning me out."
>
> **Solution:** "Then I found [app name]. It automates the whole thing."
>
> **Demo:** "Look how quick this is..." [show the app]
>
> **Proof:** "Down from [X hours] to [Y minutes]. My team thinks I'm magic."
>
> **CTA:** "Try it free at [site]. No credit card required."

    excerpt:
      "The highest-converting hooks for fitness brands on TikTok. Learn how to sell workout equipment, supplements, and programs to the fitness community.",
    content: `# Fitness TikTok Ads: Hooks That Sell Gym Equipment and Supplements

Fitness content is native to TikTok. The brands winning aren't running ads—they're creating content that happens to sell products. Here are the hook patterns that convert for fitness brands.

## Why Fitness Performs So Well on TikTok

TikTok and fitness align perfectly: transformation content, before/after results, and authentic testimonials from real people. The fitness brands winning focus on problems, not products.

## 1. The "Stop Doing This" Hook

> "Stop doing cardio if you want to lose fat."

**Why it works:** Contrarian advice stops the scroll. It challenges conventional wisdom, making people watch to understand why.

**Examples:**
- "Stop doing crunches if you want abs."
- "Why I stopped doing long cardio."
- "The exercise that's actually hurting your progress."

## 2. The Specific Problem Hook

> "If you have lower back pain, watch this."

**Why it works:** Pain points in fitness are universal and emotional. You're offering relief to a specific problem.

**Examples:**
- "This fixed my knee pain in two weeks."
- "If your wrists hurt during pushups, try this."
- "The fix for tight hips from sitting all day."

## 3. The Timeline Transformation Hook

> "My 8-week transformation using only this."

**Why it works:** TikTok loves before/afters. A specific timeline makes the claim credible.

**Examples:**
- "What 30 days of this exercise did to my core."
- "My 12-week transformation with one piece of equipment."
- "The 6-week challenge that changed my body."

## 4. The "This One Thing" Hook

> "This one piece of equipment replaced my entire gym."

**Why it works:** Simplification appeals to busy people. You're promising results with less complexity.

**Examples:**
- "This \$30 tool replaced my home gym."
- "The only supplement you actually need."
- "One exercise that changed my physique."

## 5. The Myth-Busting Hook

> "Why ab exercises won't give you abs."

**Why it works:** Education builds authority. You're positioning yourself as an expert sharing valuable information.

**Examples:**
- "Why more protein isn't always better."
- "The cardio myth that's wasting your time."
- "What nobody tells you about building muscle."

## 6. The Struggle Validation Hook

> "I almost quit before I found this."

**Why it works:** Fitness is hard. Validating the struggle builds authentic connection.

**Examples:**
- "I was about to give up until I tried this."
- "The mistake that stalled my progress for months."
- "Why I almost quit fitness (and how I saved it)."

## 7. The Accessible Hook

> "You don't need a gym for this workout."

**Why it works:** Gym intimidation is real. You're removing barriers and making fitness accessible.

**Examples:**
- "This full-body workout needs zero equipment."
- "Get fit at home with just this one tool."
- "No gym? No problem. Try this instead."

## 8. The Comparison Hook

> "Expensive vs. cheap—is there a difference?"

**Why it works:** Fitness shoppers compare everything. You're providing valuable information.

**Examples:**
- "Testing a \$200 supplement against a \$20 one."
- "Home gym vs. gym membership—what's actually better?"
- "Is the expensive equipment worth it?"

## 9. The Energy/Performance Hook

> "This pre-workout actually works."

**Why it works:** Results matter in fitness. Claims of effectiveness are compelling when they sound authentic.

**Examples:**
- "The supplement that finally gave me energy."
- "I finally have energy for my afternoon workouts."
- "Why this pre-workout hits different."

## 10. The Meal/Prep Hack Hook

> "This meal prep hack saved me hours."

**Why it works:** Nutrition is 80% of fitness results. Time-saving tips are valuable to busy people.

**Examples:**
- "Meal prep takes me 30 minutes now. Here's how."
- "The breakfast that changed my energy all day."
- "My \$3 high-protein meal that takes 5 minutes."

> **Problem:** "I kept saying I'd start Monday. Every Monday. For two years."
>
> **Turning Point:** "Then I found this approach that actually fits my life."
>
> **Proof:** "Six months later, I'm down [amount] and I actually enjoy working out."
>
> **CTA:** "Link in bio. Start with a free trial."

## Pro Tips for Fitness Ads

1. **Show real people, not just models** - Authenticity matters more than perfection on TikTok.
2. **Include specific numbers** - "15 pounds" beats "weight loss." "30 days" beats "quickly."
3. **Address the difficulty** - Fitness is hard. Acknowledging this builds trust.
4. **Show the product in use** - Demonstrations are more convincing than descriptions.
5. **Target specific goals** - "Get fit" is too vague. "Build core strength" is specific.

## Common Fitness Ad Mistakes

- **Unrealistic promises** - "Get abs in a week" will damage credibility and may get flagged.
- **Generic motivation** - "Just do it" isn't helpful. Show exactly how.
- **Ignoring beginners** - Not everyone is fit. Speak to people starting their journey.
- **Too professional** - Over-produced ads feel like infomercials. Keep it raw.
- **Missing the why** - Don't just show exercises. Explain why they work.

## Complete Example: Resistance Bands Ad

> **Hook:** "Stop scrolling if you hate going to the gym."
>
> **Problem:** "I was spending \$150 a month on a gym I barely used. I felt guilty every time I drove past it."
>
> **Solution:** "Then I tried these resistance bands for \$30. Full gym at home."
>
> **Demo:** "Watch—legs, arms, back. You can do everything with these three bands."
>
> **Proof:** "Six months later, I cancelled my gym membership and I'm in better shape."
>
> **CTA:** "Link in bio. Comes with a free workout guide and 30-day money-back guarantee."

## Supplement Disclaimer Template

For supplement ads, always include natural-sounding compliance language:

> "Obviously, supplements aren't magic. You still need to train and eat right. But this helped me fill the gaps in my nutrition."

Stop staring at a blank screen. Here are 10 plug-and-play UGC script templates that work across categories. Just fill in the brackets and you're ready to film.

## What Makes UGC Scripts Different

UGC (user-generated content) style ads feel like real creator content, not commercials. They use casual language, authentic delivery, and focus on personal experience rather than product features.

**Best for:** Products that solve a clear pain point

## Quick Fill Guide

Fill these in before choosing a template:

- **Product:** What are you selling?
- **Price:** How much does it cost?
- **Problem:** What pain point does it solve?
- **Result:** What specific outcome does it deliver?
- **Timeframe:** How long to see results?
- **Proof:** Reviews, personal experience, social proof?

## Pro Tips for Using These Templates

1. **Customize the hook** - The first 3 seconds matter most. Make it specific to your audience.
2. **Keep it conversational** - Use words you'd actually say. Avoid corporate language.
3. **Show, don't just tell** - Demonstrate the product whenever possible.
4. **Be specific with numbers** - "\$12" beats "affordable." "Two weeks" beats "quickly."
5. **Add natural delivery** - Umms, pauses, and restarts make it feel authentic.

## Filming Tips

- **Use natural lighting** - Overhead lights look fake
- **Film vertically** - TikTok is 9:16 format
- **Get close to the camera** - Intimacy builds connection
- **Keep cuts minimal** - Jump cuts are okay, but don't over-edit
- **Include captions** - Many watch without sound

## CTA Variations by Goal

- **Sales:** "Link in bio. Try it risk-free for [days] days."
- **Traffic:** "Link in bio to learn more."
- **Urgency:** "Only [number] left at this price."
- **Discount:** "Use code [CODE] for [amount] off."

      "A comprehensive comparison of TikTok and Instagram Reels for advertising. Learn the key differences, audience demographics, and which platform performs better for different product categories.",
    content: `# TikTok vs Instagram Reels: Where Should You Run Your Ads?

Both platforms offer massive reach and short-form video. But they're not interchangeable. Here's how to decide where to focus your ad budget in 2026.

## Quick Stats at a Glance

| Metric | TikTok | Instagram Reels |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Monthly Active Users | 1.5B+ | 2B+ (Instagram overall) |
| Average Age | 18-34 | 18-44 |
| Ad CTR Average | 1-3% | 0.5-1.5% |
| Cost per 1K Impressions | \$5-15 | \$8-25 |
| Best For | Discovery | Conversion |

## The Key Difference: Intent

**TikTok is for discovery.** Users come to be entertained and find new things. They're open to content from creators they don't follow. This makes TikTok ideal for new product launches and awareness campaigns.

**Instagram is for intent.** Users follow accounts they're interested in. Reels are served to people likely to engage based on their interests. This makes Instagram better for retargeting and conversion-focused campaigns.

## Audience Demographics

### TikTok Users:
- 60% are Gen Z (18-24)
- 30% are Millennials (25-40)
- Skew slightly female (60/40 split)
- Global reach with strong presence in US, Southeast Asia, Middle East
- Average 95 minutes/day spent on app

### Instagram Reels Users:
- More evenly distributed across 18-44
- Higher income bracket (\$50k+ households)
- Skew slightly female (51/49 split)
- Stronger in US, Europe, Australia
- Average 30 minutes/day on Instagram overall

**Takeaway:** If you sell to Gen Z, TikTok is non-negotiable. If your audience is 30+, Instagram may deliver better ROI.

## Algorithm Differences

### TikTok's Algorithm:
- Prioritizes watch time and completion rate
- Less dependent on follower count
- Pushes content to new audiences aggressively
- Viral potential is higher
- Trends move fast (lifespan of 2-7 days)

### Instagram's Algorithm:
- Prioritizes engagement from followers first
- Then expands to similar audiences
- More consistent performance over time
- Relationship-driven (followers matter more)
- Trends have longer lifespan (1-3 weeks)

**Takeaway:** TikTok is better for explosive growth. Instagram is better for consistent, predictable performance.

## Content Style Differences

### TikTok Content Works Best When:
- Native to the platform (not reposted)
- Uses trending sounds and effects
- Feels like UGC (user-generated content)
- Has strong hooks in first 1-2 seconds
- Lean production value (raw feels more authentic)
- Vertical 9:16 format only

### Instagram Reels Content Works Best When:
- Slightly more polished than TikTok
- Cross-platform friendly (can repost to TikTok)
- Uses trending audio but less dependent on it
- Strong visual aesthetic matters more
- Vertical 9:16 format (but horizontal clips can work)
- More forgiving of branded content

## By Product Category

### Beauty & Skincare
- **Winner:** TikTok
- **Why:** #BeautyTok has 150B+ views. Native demos and testimonials perform exceptionally well.

### Tech & Apps

## Script & Hook Adaptations

### TikTok Scripts Should:
- Start with a bolder hook (you have less time)

- **Creative refresh** every 2 weeks on TikTok, every 4 weeks on Instagram

## When to Use Both

1. **Product launches** - Use TikTok for buzz, Instagram for conversion
2. **Holiday campaigns** - Both platforms, adapted creative
3. **Retargeting** - Start on TikTok, retarget on Instagram
4. **Always-on branding** - Maintain presence on both with smaller budgets

## Performance Benchmarks

### Good Performance on TikTok:
- CTR: 2%+
- CPC: Under \$0.50

### Good Performance on Instagram:

## The Verdict

**Choose TikTok if:**
- Your audience is under 30
- You need awareness/traffic
- Your product is visual and demo-friendly
- You can commit to posting frequently
- You're comfortable with raw, UGC-style content

**Choose Instagram if:**
- Your audience is 30-45
- You need conversions/sales
- Your brand is premium or aesthetic-focused
- You prefer consistent, predictable results
- You have polished brand assets

**Best approach:** Start with both at 50/50 split, measure results for 60 days, then allocate based on actual performance data for your specific product.

    excerpt:
      "Breakdown of 7 real TikTok ad examples that drove massive ROI. Analyze what made these ads work and how to apply the same principles to your products.",
    content: `# 7 TikTok Ad Examples That Generated Millions in Sales

What makes a TikTok ad actually work? Let's break down 7 real examples that drove millions in revenue, analyze why they performed, and show how to apply the same principles to your products.

## Example 1: The "Don't Buy" Hook (Skincare Brand)

**The Hook:** "Don't buy retinol until you watch this."

**What Followed:** A creator explaining that retinol requires specific usage to work—then introducing their brand's retinol as the "foolproof" option.

**Why It Worked:**
- Reverse psychology built trust
- Positioned the brand as helpful, not salesy
- Educated first, sold second
- Addressed a common frustration (retinol irritation)

**Key Takeaway:** When you tell people NOT to buy, they listen. Then you can guide them to YOUR solution as the exception.

**Template for Your Product:**
> "Don't buy [product category] until you know [common mistake or concern]."

## Example 2: The Extreme Visual (Cleaning Product)

**The Hook:** "Wait for what happens at 0:15"

**What Followed:** A gross, stained surface being cleaned with dramatic close-ups of the dirt lifting off.

**Why It Worked:**
- Created curiosity (had to wait for the payoff)
- Satisfying visual (ASMR factor)
- Immediate proof of effectiveness
- No talking required—universal appeal

**Key Takeaway:** Visual proof beats verbal claims every time. If your product does something visible, show it close up.

**Template for Your Product:**
> "Wait for the [before/after/transformation]."

## Example 3: The Price Reveal (Tech Accessory)

**The Hook:** "This \$30 gadget replaced my \$150 one."

**What Followed:** Side-by-side comparison showing both products doing the same thing, with the \$30 one actually performing better.

**Why It Worked:**
- Specific price comparison created value perception
- Underdog story (cheap beats expensive)
- Saved viewers money—universal appeal
- Demonstrated, not just claimed

**Key Takeaway:** Price anchoring works. Position your product against a more expensive alternative to highlight value.

**Template for Your Product:**
> "This [your price] [product] does what [expensive price] does."

## Example 4: The Timeline Transformation (Fitness Equipment)

**The Hook:** "My 90-day transformation using only this."

**What Followed:** Day 1 footage showing struggle, followed by weekly updates, ending with dramatic results and the one piece of equipment used.

**Why It Worked:**
- Specific timeline (90 days felt real, not fake)
- Authentic footage (not perfect, showed struggles)
- One solution (simplicity)
- Journey format (kept viewers watching)

**Key Takeaway:** Transformation content is TikTok catnip. Make it specific, show the struggle, and keep it simple.

**Template for Your Product:**
> "My [timeframe] transformation using only [your product]."

## Example 5: The Product Fail Story (Beauty Brand)

**The Hook:** "I tried everything. Nothing worked."

**What Followed:** Story of trying 10+ products, showing each "failure," then finding the solution and finally getting results.

**Why It Worked:**
- Validated viewer frustration
- Built authenticity through failure
- Made the eventual success feel earned
- Relatable struggle

**Key Takeaway:** Failure stories build more trust than perfect success stories. Show the struggle.

**Template for Your Product:**
> "I tried [alternatives]. Nothing worked. Then I found this."

## Example 6: The "I Can't Believe" Hook (Home Product)

**The Hook:** "I can't believe this isn't more expensive."

**What Followed:** Unboxing a surprisingly premium product that cost much less than expected, showing features and quality details.

**Why It Worked:**
- Curiosity (why is it cheap?)
- Premium presentation (looked expensive)
- Perceived value exceeded price
- Discovering a "deal" feels good

**Key Takeaway:** When price is lower than quality suggests, lead with quality first, then reveal price.

**Template for Your Product:**
> "I can't believe this is only [price]."

## Example 7: The Social Proof Avalanche (Food Product)

**The Hook:** "Everyone in my comments asked about this."

**What Followed:** Showing comment after comment asking about the product, then revealing what it was and explaining why everyone was interested.

**Why It Worked:**
- Other people are interested (I should be too)
- FOMO (everyone knows except me)
- Real comments (authentic social proof)
- Answered the question viewers didn't know they had

**Key Takeaway:** Use other people's curiosity to build your own. It's more powerful than your own claims.

**Template for Your Product:**
> "Everyone keeps asking about my [result]. Here's the secret."

## Common Patterns Across All Examples

1. **Strong hook in first 3 seconds** - Every example stopped the scroll immediately
2. **Visual demonstration** - Show, don't tell
3. **Authentic delivery** - Sounded like real people, not actors
4. **Specific details** - Prices, timelines, results
5. **Clear CTA** - Always knew what to do next

## What These Ads Didn't Do

- Start with brand context or history
- Use overly promotional language
- Make generic claims without proof
- Sound scripted or corporate
- Ignore the platform's native style

## How to Apply These Patterns

### Step 1: Choose a Framework
- Don't Buy
- Visual Proof
- Price Comparison
- Transformation
- Fail Story
- Value Surprise
- Social Proof

### Step 2: Adapt to Your Product
Fill in the bracketed sections from the templates above with your specific details.

### Step 3: Test Variations
Create 3-5 versions of each framework with different hooks and angles.

### Step 4: Measure and Iterate
Track CTR, watch time, and conversion. Double down on winning frameworks.

## The Universal Template

If you only remember one thing from this breakdown, use this template:

> **[0-3s]** [Hook that creates curiosity, controversy, or identification]
>
> **[3-15s]** [Problem or situation your audience relates to]
>
> **[15-30s]** [Your product as the solution with specific details]
>
> **[30-45s]** [Proof or demonstration of results]
>
> **[45-60s]** [Clear CTA with incentive or urgency]

## Before You Create

Ask yourself:
1. What's the boldest claim I can make that's still true?
2. What's the most visual way to show my product working?
3. What's the most frustrating problem my product solves?
4. What's the most surprising thing about my product?

Your answers are your hooks. Build your ad around the strongest one.
